## Current status

Emulator is at the very early stage of development, so nothing useful is implemented yet :P

### Implemented so far

- display & pre-loaded font (4x8 "atari-small" from the [Tom's Fonts](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/x11fonts.html))

### Things to do

- keyboard
- storage
