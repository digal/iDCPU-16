## Wut?

- [DCPU-16](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt)
- [Other DCPU-16-related stuff on GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1098-take-over-the-galaxy-with-github)

## Current status

Emulator is at the very early stage of development, so nothing useful is implemented yet :P

### Implemented so far

- reading and writing values (internal): registers, stack, memory, literal values
- 11/16 ops: `SET`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`, `MOD`, `SHL`, `SHR`, `AND`, `BOR`, `XOR`

### Things to do

- remaining 5 ops
- assembly language
- emulator GUI (virtual screen)
- IDE
